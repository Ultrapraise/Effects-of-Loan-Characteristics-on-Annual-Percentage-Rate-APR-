## Summary of Findings

> I am perticularly interested in finding out what features affect loan outcomes, borrowerâ€™s Annual Percentage Rate (APR), interest rate and the impact of employment status and debt - to - income ratio on loan status and loan amount.

> Quite surprisingly, most of borrowers with monthly income above 100k loan less than 5k dollars, It's most likely the very large stated monthly income may be made up numbers.

> We see that borrowers with stated monthly income greater than 100,000 are mostly Self-employed. It's possible that since there is not verifiable source of income thay can lie about their income
